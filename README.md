# GoCallReminderAPI

## What is this tool?
This is the Go script that run every couple of time in a day to confirm my API is still running OK in AWS

## Why I created this tool
I want to learn Go but currently I am too lazy to learn the basic. I just want to dive deep into the confusion and practice it

## Further Integration
- Create API
- Docker
- Using Database for Better Scheduling
